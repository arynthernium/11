# win11

A Windows 11 style experience built with HTML+CSS+JS.

The idea is to make this as fully-functional and extensible (i.e. adding openable "apps" through iframes and things like that) as possible. I also want to make fully functioning "system-like" controls e.g. global volume controls, brightness, settings, etc. I also want to have the ability to create/read/write files, which will be stored permanently with BrowserFS.

The last time I tried to make something like this ([available here](https://github.com/arynthernium/winUI)), I had several inconsistencies and things I wanted to do differently. I also had no real direction for where I wanted to go with the project, and didn't have any idea what things I wanted to do.
